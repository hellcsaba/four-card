## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM notation
- CSS transitions

### What I learned

During this project I learnt how to leverage CSS grid properties. Additionally, I implemented the layout for mobile, tablet and desktop view as well. I added transitions to the cards for when they are hovered.
